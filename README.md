# Bidirectional_linked_list
Bidirectional linked list written in C.
This list allows the user to point to an specific node and extract its information. You can move your point of interest 
by moving the pointer located inside the Bidlist structure called poi (point of interest). As the name of the repository says,
it's a bidirectional linked list, that means that each node is pointing each other.
